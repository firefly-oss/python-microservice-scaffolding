Introduction
============

Python Microservice Scaffolding is a template for building microservices using FastAPI, Pydantic, and SQLAlchemy.
It provides a solid foundation with best practices for developing, testing, and deploying microservices.

Features
--------

- **FastAPI** for high-performance API with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Pydantic** for data validation and settings management
- **SQLAlchemy** for database ORM
- **Alembic** for database migrations
- **Poetry** for dependency management
- **Pytest** for testing
- **Docker** for containerization
- **PostgreSQL** for database

Development Tools
----------------

The scaffolding includes several development tools to ensure code quality and maintainability:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **Flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking
- **Bandit** for security scanning
- **Safety** for dependency vulnerability checking
- **pre-commit** for running checks before commits
- **Sphinx** for documentation
- **Prometheus** for metrics
- **Structlog** for structured logging

CI/CD
-----

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration that:

- Runs tests
- Checks code quality
- Performs security scanning
- Reports test coverage
